**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This work is done as a research project in the Methods of Machine Learning group at the University of TÃ¼bingen.

The goal is to investigate methods to approximate the [Generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) matrix](https://aleximmer.github.io/assets/immer_msc_thesis.pdf), a positive semi-definite approximation to the often indefinite Hessian of deep neural networks.
While second-order information can be helpful to improve training or do uncertainty quantification, the computation of the GGN is still a hurdle due to the summation over the entire dataset.
Here, we try to approximate the GGN in the data dimension.


## Installation

To run the scripts in this repository, **Python 3.10** is needed.
Then, simply create a virtual environment and install the required packages via

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The python script `src/train.py` is used to train a deep neural network and extract the GGN, which is stored on disk afterwards.
It implements a command line interface that allows specifying the used dataset, model architecture and several other hyperparameters.
**Important:** It must be run inside the directory `src/`.
For the details, invoke the script with the flag `-h`/`--help`.
